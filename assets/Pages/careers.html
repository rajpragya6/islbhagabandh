				Schools are required to provide appropriate career education from Year 7 upwards. Schools also need to ensure that young people who are at risk of leaving school early have the necessary skills for work.

                Students will have access to career education and guidance in their school. The ultimate goal is for young people to leave school with:

                <ul>
                	
                	<li>a developed sense of self-awareness.</li>
                    <li> an awareness of opportunities</li>
                    <li>the ability to make decisions and plans.</li>
                    <li>the ability to take action.</li>


                </ul>
