		<p> It is an honour and a privilege to be the Principal of ISL Bhagaband, the school that stands for excellence and continuously sets the highest standards. The school came into existence with the vision of creating a safe and supportive environment for its students – to provide a perfect balance of academics, sports, artistic and social opportunities. Childhood, youth and learning should be a joy and we strive for that.

			Education is a systematic process through which a child or an adult acquires knowledge, experience, skill and sound attitude. It makes an individual civilized, refined, cultured and educated. For a civilized and socialized society, education is the only means. Its goal is to make an individual perfect. Every society gives importance to education because it is a panacea for all evils. It is the key to solve the various problems of life.

			Education with the vocational aim will prepare each individual for an occupation which will suit to his needs, abilities, interests and attitudes. Vocational aim of education is also superscripted as ‘Bread and Butter, aim’, ‘Blue Jacket Aim’ and ‘White collar Aim’. M. K. Gandhi says, “True education ought to be for the boys and girls a kind of insurance against unemployment”.

			 The world today is changing at such an accelerated rate and we as educators need to keep pace and reflect on the education system that prevails today. Amidst this change, we create an environment to provide educational experience that will develop high academic standard and discipline of all cadets. Through the unflinching efforts of faculty members, the school has shown its worth in imparting quality education and nurturing values in the young minds. While it's not the time to feel complacent over the achievements but rather continue to progress. It gives me great satisfaction that the school is moving firmly towards the overall development and personality of the cadets.<br>
             We pledge to continue this journey on the road to excellence as we stand committed to ensure development of each cadet as a better citizen of tomorrow.<br>

             Jai Hind.
